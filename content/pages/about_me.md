Aloha! Jolene's here!

I came to Australia from China in Sep 2017 and I was going on a journey to explore a new world as well as myself.

After almost 4 years of the thrilling experience of being a business development in Australia-China cross-border FMCG trading, I finally made up my mind to change my career to a cloud engineer! What a sudden change! I was thinking this for quite a while. I chose to be a BD when I first came to Australia was mainly because I thought this position would get me adopted with the new environment quickly and I won't be here for more than 1 year.

Now the situation changed. My personal life will no longer be in China but here. I am rooted in Australia together with my family. That made me think about my career again. I remember when I was working as a system support and architect in China, I was always fascinated by the technologies and the beauty of logic behind it. I haven't done much coding in my previous IT-related jobs and technologies involved so rapidly since I left. It's never too late to become who I've always wanted to be! I decided to quit my job and start a new journey.

Currently, I am learning from the scratch including Coding(python,bash), Cloud compute(AWS), Infrastructure as code(Terraform), CI/CD pipeline(GitActions), Version control(git). This website is nothing but to keep my learning experience all in one place and if my blog could help anyone like me, it will be wonderful!
