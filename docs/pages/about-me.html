<strong>Aloha! Jolene here!</strong>
<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">
I came to Australia from China in Sep 2017 and I was going on a journey to explore a new world as well as myself.
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">
After almost 4 years of being a business development manager in Australia-China cross-border FMCG trading, I finally made up my mind to change my career to a cloud engineer! What a sudden change! I was thinking this for quite a while. I chose to be a BDM when I first came to Australia was mainly because I thought this position would get me adopted with the new environment quickly and I won't be here for more than 1 year.
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Now the situation changed. My personal life will no longer be in China but here. I am rooted in Australia together with my family. That made me think about my career again. I remember when I was working as a system support and architect in China, I was always fascinated by the technologies and the beauty of logic behind it. I haven't done much coding in my previous IT-related jobs and technologies involved so rapidly since I left. I knew it would be a big challenge, but it's never too late to become who I've always wanted to be! I quit my job and start a new journey.
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am learning from the scratch including coding (Python, Bash), cloud compute (AWS), infrastructure as code (Terraform), CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions), version control (Git). This website is nothing but to keep my learning experience all in one place and if my blog could help anyone like me, it will be wonderful!
